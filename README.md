# asm8085

A two-pass assembler written in NodeJS for 8085
It's a school project.
Feel free to use `instructionSet.js` for any purpose!
__NOTE:__ This project is still in development and is far from final version.

# Usage (TODO)
`node cli fileName`

# Test
`npm test`

I've tried to design the assembler in a modular way, 
so one can build assembler for any architecture by just changing the `instructionSet.js`
as per the processor and maybe write some extra functions for advanced assembler directives.
